# Work-Day-Scheduler



Having a good work-life balance is extremely important. A good online Work Scheduler is a great start to keeping one's career and life appropriately balanced.   This calendar keeps the date and time automatically updated the current time.   The scheduler saves all entered events.  Color-coded time blocks can help a busy professional to stay on track.
